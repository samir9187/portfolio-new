Users can add, edit, and delete transactions, categorize them (e.g., food, entertainment, bills), and set budgets for different categories.

The app provides real-time data visualization, showing the userâ€™s expenses versus their budget in graphical form. This helps in understanding spending habits and allows users to make informed decisions about their financial future. Additionally, it offers a secure login system, ensuring that only authorized users can access their data.

With its responsive design, the Expense Tracker works seamlessly across all devices, making it accessible wherever you go. This project helped me refine my skills in full-stack web development, API integration, and user authentication.
